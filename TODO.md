# List of future improvments

* Extracting viewer as an "add-on" of some kind.
* Having a way to convert the units? either on hover or permanentely.
* Having a "brewday" view, which give you only what's relevant for that.
* Having a way to open local files in Jales? Maybe look for a shell extension? or Drag and drop?
