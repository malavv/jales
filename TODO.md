# Plan of attack

## UX

* Having a way to open local files in Jales? Maybe look for a shell extension? or Drag and drop?
* Have the Jales Viewer "watch" the recipe file?
* Fix bottom BeerJSON ver. for actual version.

## Refactoring

* Extracting viewer as an "add-on" of some kind.
* Having a way to convert the units? either on hover or permanentely.

## Future work

* Having a "brewday" view, which give you only what's relevant for that.
